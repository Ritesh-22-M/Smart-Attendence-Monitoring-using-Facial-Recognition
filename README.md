## Introduction
This project implements an automated attendance system using facial recognition technology and Raspberry Pi with a Pi Camera Module. It eliminates manual sign-ins, reduces administrative workload, and prevents fraud like "buddy punching." Leveraging machine learning, face detection libraries, and real-time data logging in an Excel sheet, the system provides a reliable and scalable solution for schools, workplaces, and events.
