## Introduction
This project implements an automated attendance system using facial recognition technology and Raspberry Pi with a Pi Camera Module. It eliminates manual sign-ins, reduces administrative workload, and prevents fraud like "buddy punching." Leveraging machine learning, face detection libraries, and real-time data logging in an Excel sheet, the system provides a reliable and scalable solution for schools, workplaces, and events. 

## Features✅
Automated Facial Recognition – Identifies individuals based on unique facial features with high accuracy

Real-Time Attendance Logging – Records attendance instantly  without manual intervention 

Excel Sheet Integration – Automatically updates attendance records in an Excel file for easy tracking and management

Fraud Prevention – Eliminates buddy punching and other attendance manipulation

Raspberry Pi Integration – Cost-effective, flexible, and easy to deploy

Machine Learning-Based Accuracy – Utilizes advanced algorithms for precise recognition

Local Database Storage – Securely stores attendance records for easy access and management

Scalable & Customizable – Adaptable to different environments like schools, offices, and events
